Madison,

I just wanted to say how grateful I am for you and for everything that makes us us.
You make life more fun, more meaningful, and way better just by being in it.

And the best part?
We get to spend Valentine’s Day together in East Hampton —
staying at the Maidstone, slowing things down, laughing, and doing it right.
Dinner at The Topping Rose by Jean-Georges, good food, good wine, and even better company.

I can’t wait.

Love,
Kyle
